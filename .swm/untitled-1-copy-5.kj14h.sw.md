## This repo is for Vue 2

You are looking at the repository for Vue 2. The repo for Vue 3 is [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core).

## Sponsors

Vue.js is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by the support of these awesome [backers](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/BACKERS.md). If you'd like to join them, please consider [sponsor Vue's development](https://vuejs.org/sponsor/).

## Introduction

Vue (pronounced `/vjuÀê/`, like view) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Vue.js supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
